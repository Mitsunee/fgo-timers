description: >-
  To help Masters prepare for Lostbelt 5.2 (coming this month!) AP Costs for
  Main Quests will be reduced. First Clears on Free Quests in Arc 2 will also
  benefit from AP reductions and there is a Saint Quartz reward for clearing (or
  already having cleared) Lostbelt 5.1 during this Campaign's period.

  Note: Due to an ongoing rewrite the Limited Master Missions may not immediatly
  display on the Timers page.
