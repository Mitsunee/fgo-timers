  Great Void Sea Battle, Imaginary Scramble is a unique Event featuring special
  mechanics and a story connected to Lostbelt 4. To access it Lostbelt 1 clear is
  required. The Summoning Banner features the new SSR Servants Van Gogh and Nemo,
  as well as a set of Event Craft Essences. While Van Gogh is a limited Servant
  Nemo will be available in the general gacha pool in future banners.

  To accompany this new Event we have been given a bunch of features and QoL
  updates early, including but not limited to: Triple Support Setup System,
  Skill Animation Skip, Fullscreen NP Animation Updates for many Servants,
  Animation Skip for Enhancement Level Up Displays and a "Receive All" button for
  Master Missions. You can see the full list of every update in the Updates tab
  in the ingame News menu or on the official website.
