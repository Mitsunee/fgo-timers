  The first Lostbelt No. 5 Pickup Summon features the brand new Servants Super
  Orion (SSR 5* Archer) and Mandricardo (3* Rare Rider). 4* Assassin Chiyome will
  also be on rateup during this summoning banner.

  Super Orion is a limited Servant and will thus not appear in the regular or
  Story Gacha summoning pools until he gets another rateup. Mandricardo will be
  added to the regular (and Story Gacha) pools as well as the Friend Point
  Summoning banner.
