  The Summoning Banner for Lostbelt 5.2 features brand new permanent SSR Saber
  Dioscuri and storylocked SR Lancer Caenis, as well a set of new Craft Essences.

  The new Craft Essences are not on a rateup, but will be added to the general
  summoning pool after this banner, replacing the current 3* CE 'The Beauty at
  the Window'.

  Both of the new Servants are available to any Master on this banner for its
  entire duration. There are no rateup rotations.
