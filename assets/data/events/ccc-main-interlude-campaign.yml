  To celebrate the introduction of the new Main Interlude Abyssal Cyber Paradise,
  SE.RA.PH it will be free for all Masters, giving everyone a final chance to
  get 4* Moon Cancer BB for free!

  Additional copies of BB will be available in the Rare Prism Shop after this
  campaign ends, at which point the Main Interlude will be unlockable there as
  well. Note that this Main Interlude will be made free to access around White
  Day 2024, at which point the Rare Prisms used to unlock it will be refunded.
  All items required for Story completion are available in a special shop inside
  the Main Interlude. The Event Missions are not available, thus all items are
  now sold for QP.

  In addition to the Main Interlude there are 3 new Rank Up Quests for Kingprotea,
  Meltryllis (Alter Ego) and Suzuka Gozen, as well as 2x EXP for 4* BB. All Arc 1
  Main Quests will be available with 1/4 AP Cost during this campaign.
