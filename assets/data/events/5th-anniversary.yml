  5th Anniversary features the grand introduction of Altria Caster, the long
  awaited Arts Loop Meta support caster, as well as 10 Campaigns, incl. many new
  rewards, Rank Up Quests, GSSR and more. In addition there is a 60sq gift from
  Kanou Yoshiki!

  Part 1 of the 10 Campaigns is are Special Login Bonuses, requiring either
  consecutive or just total logins during the Campaign Period. Day 7 of the
  consecutive Special Login Bonus rewards 10 Summoning Tickets!

  Effective immediatly Campaign #2 introduces a new Extreme difficulty for Ember
  Gathering and Treasure Vault. These will allow Masters to farm for the 5* Rarity
  Embers and even more QP to help with leveling Servants beyond Level 100 with
  the previously introduced Servant Coin System. Also included is 1/2 AP for
  all Ember Gathering and Training Grounds Quests for a limited time.

  Instead of the usual 3x Success Rate Campaign #3 gives Masters a 5x Success
  Rate increase for all Servant and Craft Essence Enhancement! Campaign #4
  increases the Inventory caps, up to 300 (50 slots added) for Command Codes and
  800 each (200 slots added) for Servant and CE Inventories. Meet Da Vinci in
  the Shop tabs to purchase the new Inventory Expansions.

  Part 5 of 10 is an overhaul to the Daily Mana Prism reward structure, which
  will now be given out as Daily Master Missions instead of Quest Clear Rewards.
  This allows Masters to always claim the Mana Prisms even if they are doing
  Quests outside of Chaldea Gate! Additionally existing categories of Extra Missions
  have been expanded, letting Masters claim an additional 190sq for game progress.

  All Masters will have 5 additional Friend slots as part of Campaign #6, which
  are Master Missions that reward Masters for adding new friends and follows.
  Another Game Update is Campaign #7, which changes how Command Code Removers
  work: Command Codes can now be be removed without using a Code Remover which
  will now re-lock a Command Code slot, refunding the Command Code Opener.

  Part 9 adds Saint Quartz Fragments as additional Clear Rewards to every single
  arrow of Main Quest, totaling up to 1046 Fragments for Masters who are currently
  caught up with story (that's 149 Saint Quartz!). Campaign #8 (Rank Up Quests)
  and Campaign #10 (GSSR), as well as the Re-Rerun of 'All the Statesmen!' have
  their own Timer Pages. Please see those for more information!

  In addition to the 10 Campaigns there will be 5 brand new Spiritron Dress
  Aquisition Quests, including Costumes for Arjuna (Archer), Leonardo Da Vinci
  (Rider), (4*) Nero (Saber), Izo and Bunyan! To celebrate the introduction of
  a brand new Craft Essence in the Mana Prism Exchange Shop there will also be
  limited Inventories in both Mana Prism and Rare Prism Exchanges!

  A Trial Quest for Altria Caster and new Memorial Quests will be available with
  this Campaign. To help new Masters there is another new Game mechanic called
  Pure Prisms, which can be earned during Main Quests, as well as a rebalancing
  of Ember rarity, QP amounts and Material droprates of enemies in Main and Free
  Quests! Finally the Team Cost ceilings below Master Level 120 have been increased
  and new Tutorial Missions will be added to the Extra Mission tab.

  All Updates not listed below are available immediatly after the Maintenance
