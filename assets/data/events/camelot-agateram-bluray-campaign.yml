  To celebrate the release of the "Fate/Grand Order THE MOVIE Divine Realm of
  the Round Table: Camelot Wandering; Agateram" movie on Bluray you will be able
  to view the first scene of the movie ingame.

  In addition we are getting a series of 4 Login Bonuses, each with a promotional
  Craft Essence, as well as Arash and Bedivere getting their animation updates and
  new (widescreen!) Noble Phantasm animations early. Bedivere's costume "Silver
  Butler" is also getting added to the Mana Prism Exchange!

  Servants that appear in the movie such as Nitocris, Ozymandias and Bedivere
  will be giving x2 Friend points during the first week of this campaign.
