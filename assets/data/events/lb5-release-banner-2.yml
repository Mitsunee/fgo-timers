  The second Lostbelt No. 5 Pickup Summon features the brand new Servant Europa
  (SSR 5* Rider). Achilles and the limited Ruler Astraea are also featured as
  rateups during this summoning banner. The rateup schedule cycles between the
  two SSRs with Astraea and Hektor always being on rateup (see below).

  Europa will be added to the general pool alongside the three new Craft
  Essences One Who Wishes for Salvation, The Beginning of Ambition and Noble
  Piece. The 3* CE Bygone Dream will be removed fromm the general pool after
  this banner.
