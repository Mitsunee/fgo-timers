  The Christmas 2022 Event is a Lotto Event featuring the Welfare
  Servant Karna (Santa) and introduces a new QoL feature that lets Masters roll
  100 rolls (a third of a box) at once starting with the 11th box. The featured
  Materials include: Meteor Horseshoe, Seed of Yggdrasil, Void's Dust, Mystic
  Spinal Fluid and the usual item contents such as EXP Cards, QP and Mana
  Prisms.

  The Summoning Banner features the new SSR Lancer Vritra (who will be added to the Permanent Pool after this Event) as well as limited SR Martha (Ruler), permanent SR Beowulf and a set of Event Craft Essences. Since the introduction of the Pity System there is no more rotations, it is not known if there will be separate banners for each SR Servant. The featured Servant Beowulf will also get a new Rank Up Quest that upgrades his third skill.

  Update: A second Summoning Campaign featuring two banners has been added. The banners feature permanent SSRs Karna (Lancer) and Arjuna (Archer), with both also featuring SR Lancer Parvati and the Craft Essences from Banner 1.

  Note: Events prior to 2023 New Years have not been updated to include all details.
