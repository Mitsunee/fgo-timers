  Summer 4 returns giving you a second chance at getting 4* Saber Hokusai and
  winning tons of QP! Like last time you will receive a Fever Ticket with each
  day's login rewards to be used inside the event. Unused Tickets expire at the
  end of the Exchange Shop Period!

  Note that Servant Coins are not available for Hokusai (although the Coin System
  will be added with the same patch as this event).
