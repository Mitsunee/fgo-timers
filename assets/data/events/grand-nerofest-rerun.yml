  Grand Nero Fest Summer 2023 is the rerun of the 2019 Nerofest Event featuring
  the release of Nero Claudius' Bloomers costume. The Summoning Banners feature
  5* Brynhild (Lancer), 5* Nero Claudius (Caster) and Astraea, as well as the set
  of limited Craft Essences from the Event. There will also be a 2x Success Rate
  Campaign during the Event to help Masters level up their Servants.

  Masters who have previously purchased the costume will get their 5 Rare Prisms
  refunded. The Event uses the same bonus Craft Essences as the original 2019
  Event, so check your archives for those if you played back then!
