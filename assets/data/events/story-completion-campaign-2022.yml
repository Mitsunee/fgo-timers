  This campaign introduces the Leyline Stone feature, which can be used to revive
  in Main Story battles and are available through Login Bonus and Limited Mission
  Campaigns. To further help Masters catch up on Main Story all chapters of Arc
  1 and Arc 2 will only cost 1/4 AP to clear.

  Note: This first batch of Leyline Stones will expire before the next Main Story
  Chapter releases in approx. December. Use them now to catch up to story if you
  haven't yet. The Limited Master Missions in this campaign automatically count
  as completed if you have already cleared all Main Story chapters!
