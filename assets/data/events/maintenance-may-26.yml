  This short maintenance is to adress issues with the new Servant Coin system.
  After the maintenance Masters should be getting their remaining coins based on
  Servant copies summoned that were not retroactively rewarded upon introduction
  of the system.

  All Masters will receive 3 Saint Quartz and 3 Golden Fruit as apology for this
  maintenance.
