  To celebrate 19M Downloads of Fate/Grand Order this campaign features new Extra
  Missions, Login Bonuses, Limited Missions including a new set of Leyline Stones,
  AP reductions for Main Story and Free Quest First Clears, a new MP Shop CE "Take
  Romance" and 2x Success Rate for Enchancements. During this Campaign all Ember
  Gathering and Training Ground nodes will be available every day. Finally the
  Summoning Banner features limited SSR Caster Murasaki Shikibu and the Craft
  Essences from the Valentines Event that first introduced her.

  Note: While the official news post states that all Free Quests "from Chapter 1
  to Chapter 5 (Olympus)" are included in the 1/2 AP Free Quest First Clears, it
  seems that does infact include Heian-kyo as well.
