  Hunting Quest Part 9 features a daily rotation of material farming nodes and
  introduces 90+ difficulty to this event format. There is also a Summoning
  Banner featuring limited Servants from GUDAUGDA: SSRs Okita Souji (Saber),
  Hijikata Toshizo (Berserker) and Rare Assassin Okada Izo. The SSRs are on a
  rotating schedule, while Izo is always on rateup. The featured SSR Servants
  also receive new Rank Up Quests!

  Note: Hunting Quests are Events and use the Event Support setup! Make sure to
  remove your Lotto CEs or switch your general setup to display in Events.

  Material Information from Fandom Wiki, subject to change. The rare spawn in
  every node drops Soundless Bells.
