  The 2022 Valentine's Event features the brand new SSR Archer Sei Shounagon and
  fully voiced Chocolate scenes for every servant! Send Friend Chocolates to
  fellow Masters (gives them 200 Friend Points) and receive Mana Prisms in return

  The Event uses the standard Event Point Ladder format with the Shop CE and
  Chocolate CEs giving extra points. New Free Quests open with every Story Section.

  Marie Antoinette and Gaius Julius Caesar will receive Animation Updates and each
  a Rank Up Quest as the event starts. Chocolate CEs now have a special icon in
  the top left corner and it is now possible to get multiple copies of the same
  chocolate if you kept some from previous years!
