  The (very early) Rerun of the Christmas 2021 Event features the return of
  Florence Nightingale (Santa) and a limited 10 Box Lotto. The Summoning Banner
  features rateups for limited SSR Astolfo (Saber), permanent SSRs Bradamante
  and Florence Nightingale (Berserker), storylocked SR Aśvatthāman and permanent
  SRs Astolfo (Rider) and Nursery Rhyme, as well as a set of Event Craft
  Essences. The SSRs are on a rotating schedule; there are also days with SR
  solo rateups together with Astolfo (Saber), while permanent Rares Caesar and
  Darius III are always on rateup.
