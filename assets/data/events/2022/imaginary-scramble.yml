  Great Void Sea Battle, Imaginary Scramble is a unique Event
  featuring special mechanics and a story connected to Lostbelt 4. To access it
  Lostbelt 1 clear is required. The Summoning Banner features the new SSR
  Servants Van Gogh and Nemo, as well as a set of Event Craft Essences. While
  Van Gogh is a limited Servant Nemo will be available in the general gacha pool
  in future banners.

  To accompany this new Event we have been given a bunch of features and QoL updates early, including but not limited to: Triple Support Setup System, Skill Animation Skip, Fullscreen NP Animation Updates for many Servants, Animation Skip for Enhancement Level Up Displays and a "Receive All" button for Master Missions. You can see the full list of every update in the Updates tab in the ingame News menu or on the official website.

  Update: A second Summoning Banner featuring limited SSR Abigail Williams, and limited SRs Osakabehime (Archer) and Mysterious Alter Ego Î›, as well as the same set of Event Craft Essences as the first Banner, has been added.

  Note: Events prior to 2023 New Years have not been updated to include all details.
