  While there will be no Halloween-themed Event FGO will still be
  celebrating Halloween with this Campaign featuring a Special Login Bonus and
  2x Sucess Rate as well as 1/2 AP Rankups for select Servants. The Summoning
  Banner features rateups for limited SSR Cleopatra, permanent SSR Osakabehime,
  limited SR Ibaraki-Douji (Lancer), permanent SR Elisabeth BÃ¡thory (Lancer) and
  permanent Rares Mephistopheles and Darius III, as well as the sets of Event
  Craft Essences from previous Halloween Events! Both SSRs and SRs will each
  have solo-rateup days, so check the schedule before rolling.

  Note: Events prior to 2023 New Years have not been updated to include all details.
