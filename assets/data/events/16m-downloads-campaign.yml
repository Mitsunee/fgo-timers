  The 16 Million Downloads Campaign introduces the new Main Interlude system.
  'Merry Christmas in the Underworld' will be available as the first Main Interlude
  featuring free SR Archer Servant Attila the San(ta).

  The new Main Interlude will be available for free during the Campaign period.
  You can permanently unlock San(ta) by completing the Main Interlude. Any
  Enhancements on the temporary copy will carry over should you not finish the
  Quests and decide to unlock them again later in the Rare Prism Shop.

  After the Campaign period the Main Interlude will be unlockable in the Rare
  Prism Shop for 5RP, as well as additional copies of San(ta) being purchasable
  for 2RP each (up to 4 copies).

  In addition to the Main Interlude this campaign contains Special Master Missions,
  Special Login Bonuses, 2x Success Rate, 1/2 Enhancement Cost, and more. The
  Summoning Banner features limited SSR Lancer Ereshkigal and permanent SR Lancer
  Fionn mac Cumhaill as well as the Craft Essences from the featured 'Merry
  Christmas in the Underworld' Event including 5* CE Starry Nights! There is also
  a new Craft Essence available in the Mana Prism Exchange Shop: Gran Cavallo.

  Note: Due to an ongoing rewrite the Limited Master Missions may not immediatly
  display on the Timers page.
