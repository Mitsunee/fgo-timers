  This campaign introduces the Leyline Stone feature, which can be
  used to revive in Main Story battles and are available through Login Bonus and
  Limited Mission Campaigns. To further help Masters catch up on Main Story all
  chapters of Arc 1 and Arc 2 will only cost 1/4 AP to clear.

  Note: This first batch of Leyline Stones will expire before the next Main Story Chapter releases in approx. December. Use them now to catch up to story if you haven't yet. The Limited Master Missions in this campaign automatically count as completed if you have already cleared all Main Story chapters!

  EDIT (September 1st): This campaign has been extended and a second wave of limited Master Missions has been added, giving more Leyline Stone as well as a total of 4 Saint Quartz.

  Note: Events prior to 2023 New Years have not been updated to include all details.
